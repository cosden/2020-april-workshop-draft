You can find out more and express interest in attending by filling out the **[US-RSE Workshop Interest Form](https://forms.gle/tzronZUGdUTT9zzb9)**.

The [US-RSE Workshop Interest Form](https://forms.gle/tzronZUGdUTT9zzb9) will be open until at least December 3, 2019.
We will strive to accommodate as many as possible, but workshop space is limited and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse participant group, both in terms of traditional diversity measures, but also in terms of research domain and institutional representation.
We feel strongly that a diverse community represents more potential members, has more sources for ideas, and has fewer shared assumptions that might hinder the growth of the US-RSE Association.
