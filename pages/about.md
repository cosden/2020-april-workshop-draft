Broadly speaking the First US-RSE Community Building Workshop has two
overarching goals:

1. Grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional
networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders.
1. Generate material/content for the
us-rse.org website that promotes and supports current/future RSEs in alignment
with the mission of the US-RSE.


The workshop will have breakout sessions focused on a number of different topics
pertinent to the US-RSE community. We’ll be working together to generate content
for the us-rse.org website that promotes and supports current/future RSEs in
alignment with the [mission](https://us-rse.org/mission) of the US-RSE Association. We will also plan
follow-up activities to grow the community.

One key output will be the generation of community white papers, blog posts, and
online resources.  These tangible outputs will all be hosted at us-rse.org.
Each breakout session will be focused on a particular topic (see some initial
ideas below) and have a designated leader and/or owner of the output.  Most of
these breakout sessions, using collaborative content generation (using the SSI's
[speed blogs](https://www.software.ac.uk/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-one) as a model), will lead to documents that will be ~80% completed
at the workshop. The “output owner” will be responsible for ensuring the product
of the session will be complete and the resulting document posted online within
a week after the workshop.  We'll be looking for output owner volunteers prior to the workshop.

This new material will help and support new and existing members of the
community, those who don’t identify with RSEs but work with RSEs, those who want
to support the RSE role, and those want to understand the profession better.


To target each of the three main components of the [US-RSE mission](https://us-rse.org/mission),
we anticipate breakout sessions related to:
1. Advocacy
  - Defining and advancing the RSE career path
  - Documenting the impact RSEs have on research
1. Resources
  - Case studies of RSEs and RSE groups  
  - Documenting RSE-approved best practices, techniques, and technologies  
1. Community
  - What should future workshops cover?
  - What events or activities does the RSE community want?
