visiting Princeton.

Please send any questions about travel to the workshop to TBD.

## Travel Reimbursement
All participant costs will be covered by the grant. However, please do not make travel arrangements yet. Details as to how to proceed will be provided soon.  


## Travel by Train
From Newark Liberty International (EWR) airport, John F. Kennedy International
Airport (JFK) and from many other locations along the east coast (e.g. Boston, NYC,
Washington DC and Baltimore), it is possible to travel to Princeton by train.
Note that there are two train stations you will need to know:

The major train station closest to Princeton is "Princeton Junction Station"
(PJC). This is served by New Jersey Transit on the "Northeast Corridor Line".
PJC also has some limited direct service by Amtrak. The campus train station is
"Princeton Station". This is served only by a small commuter train (the "Dinky")
which goes along a spur line from Princeton Junction Station to campus. It is
operated by New Jersey Transit. If you are coming from EWR, Trenton or NYC Penn
Station, you should buy a New Jersey Transit ticket through to Princeton
Station. You will then need to take a train to Princeton Junction train station
(check that your particular train stops there!), get off at Princeton Junction
train station and take the "Dinky" from Princeton Junction train station to
Princeton train station. From the Princeton train station it is about a 15
minute walk to the Nassau Inn. Uber and Lyft should be possible on and around
Princeton University campus, the town of Princeton, and Princeton Junction train
station.


If you are coming on Amtrak, most trains do not stop at Princeton Junction
(with only a few exceptions, see the Amtrak website).
You will need to take Amtrak to Newark or Trenton and then switch to New Jersey
Transit, as above, to arrive to Princeton Station on campus.

## Travel by Air
The closest and most convenient airport to come to Princeton is Newark Liberty
International (EWR). Most participants will find that the best solution for
domestic flights within the US. This is the recommended airport unless the cost
is significantly higher than other alternatives. From there it is convenient to
take the train as described above.

Another option is flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or
LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) at the cost of additional travel time.
From JFK, the easiest is probably to the Airtrain to Jamaica Station and then
take the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) or to New York Penn Station. Alternatively
there is the subway or a bus (NYC Airporter with service from JFK to NYC Penn
Station. From NYC Penn Station, you can take the train to Princeton as described
above.

From a small number of locations it may also be possible to fly to
Trenton-Mercer Airport. Getting from there to the Princeton campus is more
complicated and involves using an Uber or Lyft, buses, and/or going to the train
station in Trenton and taking New Jersey Transit trains, as above.
