We feel strongly that a diverse community represents more potential members,
has more sources for ideas, and has fewer shared assumptions that might hinder
the growth of the US-RSE Association.

The workshop organizers are are committed to ensuring a diverse group of participants
both in terms of traditional measures of diversity (e.g. race, gender, socioeconomic),
domains (e.g. HPC, bioinformatics, digital humanities), and organizations (e.g.
R1 institutions, national labs, industry).
