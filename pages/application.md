To express interest in attending the workshop please fill out the
[US-RSE Workshop Interest Form](https://forms.gle/tzronZUGdUTT9zzb9).
The form will be open until at least December 3, 2019.

Invitations are expected to be sent by early January.

We will strive to accommodate as many as possible, but workshop space is limited
and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse participant group, both in
terms of traditional diversity measures as well as research domain and institutional
representation.
